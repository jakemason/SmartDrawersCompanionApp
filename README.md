# Overview

Written as a companion app to a "Smart Drawer" system my friend Jonathan Yoder and I are building as an intelligent
storage system for our Commander decks for Magic: The Gathering. The physical drawers themselves feature a small
computer that allows the user to select a deck and a light will indicate where in the unit the deck is stored.
Additionally, the drawer allows creation of games based on how many players are present, what colors are desired, and
the power level the table would like to see at the game.

# Features
- Creation and storage of an arbitrary number of decks.
- Allows use of both single-image commanders, and the newer Partner-based decks which feature two commanders.
- Each deck can also be assigned a power level so that it can be matched against similar decks.
- Colors are also stored per deck so that presets can be loaded based on pieces of the pie. (Mono-colored matchups,
  tri-color matchups, etc) 


  ## Disclaimer
  I threw this thing together over a weekend so it's rough around the edges, but has worked well for our needs so far.
